This is a forked version of NppSnippets. The goal is to add commands to the snippets like variables (not in yet !).
As for now only those commands are in : 
[[[FILENAME]]]  --> replaced by the name of the current file
[[[NAMEPART]]]  --> replaced by the name whithout it's extension
[[[EXTENSION]]] --> replaced by the current's file extension

NppSnippets
===========

NppSnippets is an easy to use snippet / template plug-in for [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). Similarity with the TextPad Clip Library is no accident. To insert a snippet simply double click on the item in the list and the snippet is inserted at the current cursor position. To edit right-click on that item.

The documentation of this plug-in can be found at [Read the Docs](https://nppsnippets.readthedocs.io/). This includes:

* Instructions [how to install](https://nppsnippets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
* Instructions [how to use](https://nppsnippets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html)
